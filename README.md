# Neo-Bank Non-Subscription Churn Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains my work for the [Neo-Bank Non-Subscription Churn Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neo-bank-non-sub-churn-prediction/overview) competition hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to develop a model that accurately predicts customer churn in a neo-bank setting, focusing on non-subscription-based services.

## Project Structure

- `Notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset provided for this competition includes various features related to customer demographics, account information, and transaction history. The target variable indicates whether a customer has churned. For detailed information about the dataset, please refer to the [competition overview page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neo-bank-non-sub-churn-prediction/overview).

## Approach

In this project, I have implemented the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset by analyzing feature distributions, missing values, and correlations.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance model performance based on domain knowledge and data analysis.

4. **Model Development**: Training various machine learning models, including ensemble methods, to predict customer churn.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neo-bank-churn-prediction.git
   cd neo-bank-churn-prediction
